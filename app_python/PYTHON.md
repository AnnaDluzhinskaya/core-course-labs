# Lab 1
## Framework 

I decide to use Flask, because:
- easy to start (comprehensive documentation, a lot of tutorials)
- there is a built-in development server
- fast debugger provided 
- lightweight
- support for unit testing

## Best practices:
- follow the `PEP8` standards
- use templates for html rendering - `index.html`
- styles are located in the `static` folder

## Coding Standard:
- use `pycodestyle` for `PEP8` code standards checking
- use `PyCharm` suggestions

## Testing:
Wrote unit-tests that check
- that the displayed time is correct
- that time is changing
