# Lab 1 Bonus Task
## Framework 

I decide to use ASP.NET, because:
- I'm already familiar with C#, so this was the easiest option for me.

## Best practices:
- wrote code according to `Common C# code conventions`
- MVC architecture

## Coding Standard:
- wrote code according to `Common C# code conventions`

## Testing:
- manual testing
- unit-tests which check that dog age is correctly converted to human age in days and years

### Best practices
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use meaningful and descriptive test case names
- Test for expected behavior, not implementation details
